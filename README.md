# COMAP ICM 2022
This repository contains our submission for COMAP ICM 2022. Our team consisted of Roy Kim, Benjamin Shih, and I(Alex Zheng). We responded to ICM Problem E regarding carbon sequestration and forest harvesting. 

The solution we came up with involved a discretized, stochastic model for tree growth in the context of various types of forests. Using this model, we analyzed the total carbon sequestration over time by altering parameters such as harvest frequency, thresholds for harvesting, and tree composition to determine the forest management strategy that will maximize carbon sequestration.

Please consult our paper and relevant notebook/images for more information on models and techniques used as well as simulation strategy and results. Our paper was awarded Honorable Mention (top 22%) out of over 12,000 submssions.
